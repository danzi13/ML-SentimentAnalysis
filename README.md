# ML-sentimentAnalysis
Twitter sentiment analysis. Uses twitter API and the call to AUth1, getRecent to get the most recent 100 tweets with that specific word. It is loaded into 
a Json data set then using a sentiment analyzer we can use basic linear regression on the word and it's overall sentiment given the data set.
